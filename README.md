### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

My name is Tobias, great to see you on my GitHub account! 

I'm passionate about Open Source Software, contributing to PostgreSQL and it's community and striving to protect civil rights in the digital society. I'm also a tech geek, Apple admin and long time Xojo developer. You find me organising and speaking at conferences or driving and screwing vintage cars.

There is't much to see on this account at the moment - the repositories are mainly forks to issue PRs or experiments. 

While I'm not into Social Media, you can find me over at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/tbussmann) or [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/1169878/tbussmann) as well. To get in touch, it is best to drop me an email.
